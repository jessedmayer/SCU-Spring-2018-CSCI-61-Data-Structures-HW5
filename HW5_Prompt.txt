3. (15 pts.) Use STL's MULTIMAP class to add a map to the office hours project. Assume the professor uses the names of each student who attends office hour as the key value in a map and enters the topic he/she asked about. After 100 office hours he then generates an individualized report for each student in the form of a text file that delineates how many times they attended office hours in the 100 iterations and all the topics they came to office hours for.

Notes:

The student names can be actual names or "StudentX", where X is a number. Examples: Student1, Student2, etc.
You can generate a random string of characters for the topic or create a list of actual topics in a file to pic from randomly.
